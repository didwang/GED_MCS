Notebooks beginning with 01 build matrix-encoded synthetic routes, given a target adjacency matrix, and a .csv file detailing each stepâ€™s atom additions and bond edits.

Notebooks beginning with 02 evaluate and plot bond edit distances from connectivity matrices.

03_plot_matrices.ipynb evaluates bond types for a given route and plots individual connectivity matrices.
